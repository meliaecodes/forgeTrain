# forgeTrain
Lego City Train connected to Jira / Confluence using Forge and Pybricks

Note: I haven't included my full app directories for Forge apps, just the relevant files - to improve readability. 

To make your own forge train:

You will need
- A [Lego City train](https://www.lego.com/en-au/themes/city/train). I used the [Express Passenger Train 60337](https://www.lego.com/en-au/product/express-passenger-train-60337)
- A computer with Bluetooth and an internet connection
- An Atlassian Developer Account
- Python 3
- ngrok
- uvicorn
- Forge environment

What to do
1. [Install pybricks on your Lego City hub](https://pybricks.com/install/) - make a note of your hubs name, we'll use that later!
2. Use https://code.pybricks.com/ to store the python included in onthehub.py on your hubs flash memory [See pybricks docs](https://pybricks.com/install/technic-boost-city/#saving-a-program-on-the-hub)
